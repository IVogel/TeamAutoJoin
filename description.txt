Sets team automatically on join.
And also saves it automatically on change.
Just change your team ¯\_( :| )_/¯
 
[c/ff0000:Notes]:
    Maybe uses silly workarounds to handle team changes. (I haven't found anything better right now, maybe later.)
    It's fully clientside.
 
[c/ff0000:Changes]:
    1.2: Fully changed team save/load handler.

    1.1.1: Removed some unused content.
 
    1.1: Team autosave.
